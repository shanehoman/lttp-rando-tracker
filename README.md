## New Features
Some of these features were simply based on my needs, so it may not be fit for everybody.

* Consolidated Mushroom/Powder and Shovel/Flute to mimic the original game pause layout.
* Added bomb icon. It has no functional use other than representing the game pause layout position.
* Added a Go Mode icon that lits up when you have the necessary items to finish the game
* Changed the rotation for dungeon prizes to Crystal, 5/6 Crystal, Green Pendant, Other Pendants
* Added support for glitches. If you're able to do a certain glitch, the chest tracker will mark those extra locations as blue (breaks the logic but it's possible to get). For example, the Hobo will be marked as blue without Flippers if you can Fake Flipper.
* Added orange coloring for locations that would be available if you defeat Agahnim 1. If Aga is a possibility and you don't already have dark world access, you have a visual note of which locations would be opened if you did Aga.
* Changed color coding.

    * Orange: The boss could be defeated if you killed Aga
